### **Project Summary**

- Summary: This project aims to build an automated data processing system (Data Analytics Pipeline) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. The system is designed with an event-driven and serverless architecture, specialized for processing, cleaning, and analyzing large-scale taxi trip record datasets (TLC Trip Record Data - Yellow Taxi). The ultimate goal is to transform raw data into high-value insights that support business decision-making through interactive dashboards.
- Objectives:
  - Fully automate the data collection and processing workflow (ETL) from source to Data Warehouse.
  - Ensure data quality through automatic error detection and removal of noisy data such as outliers and missing values before analysis.
  - Provide a flexible analytics platform that supports both fast ad-hoc queries and in-depth OLAP analysis.
  - Visualize business data such as trip demand, revenue, and spatial distribution for leadership teams.
- Scope:
  - Build a Data Lake (Raw & Processed Layers) on Amazon S3.
  - Implement an automated ETL pipeline using AWS Step Functions, Lambda, and Glue DataBrew.
  - Integrate Amazon Redshift as the data warehouse and Amazon Athena as the query layer.
  - Build a BI reporting system on Amazon QuickSight.
  - Set up security, monitoring, and alerting systems using CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS.

### **Problem Statement**

Current Challenges: The Yellow Taxi dataset from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission contains a massive amount of information, but the raw data also includes a significant amount of noise and anomalies:

- Poor data quality: There are trips with no passengers (`passenger_count = null`), zero distance (`trip_distance = 0`), or negative fares (`fare_amount < 0`).
- Lack of automation: Manual processing or legacy systems are time-consuming, error-prone, and unable to scale as data volume grows monthly with new Parquet/CSV files.
- Fragmented information: Data is not centralized into a single source of truth, making revenue reporting and customer behavior analysis difficult and slow.

Technical Solution: Deploy a modern Data Lakehouse architecture on AWS:

- Automatic triggering (event-driven): Use Amazon EventBridge to automatically capture events whenever new data files are uploaded, eliminating manual steps.
- Strict quality control: Use AWS Glue DataBrew for profiling and AWS Lambda for branching logic. For example, automatically send an alert if the data error rate is greater than 20%; otherwise continue the pipeline.
- Standardization and optimization: Clean the data, create additional meaningful features such as `trip_duration` and `trip_speed`, and store it in columnar Parquet format with partitioning to optimize cost and query performance.

### **Solution Architecture**

The system architecture follows this processing flow:
Raw &rarr; Processing &rarr; Analytics &rarr; Visualization.

Technical Architecture (Workflow Overview)

- Ingestion: Raw data (Parquet/CSV) is uploaded to the S3 Raw Bucket in the Data Lake.
- Trigger: An `ObjectCreated` event from S3 triggers EventBridge.
- Orchestration: EventBridge invokes Step Functions to orchestrate the entire pipeline lifecycle, including retries and logging.
- Profiling: Glue DataBrew analyzes the dataset to identify anomalies such as missing values, outliers, and mismatches.
- Validation: Lambda reads the profiling results to determine the next step or send an error alert.
- Transformation: A Glue DataBrew recipe executes ETL tasks including data cleaning, type standardization, and feature engineering.
- Processed Storage: Cleaned data is stored in the S3 Processed Bucket in Parquet format, partitioned by Year/Month/Day.
- Data Warehousing: The `COPY` command loads data from S3 into the `fact_taxi_trip` table in Amazon Redshift for OLAP workloads. In parallel, Amazon Athena supports ad-hoc querying directly on S3.
- Visualization: Amazon QuickSight connects to Redshift and Athena to display dashboards such as Trip Demand, Revenue, and Spatial Analysis.

### **Cost Estimation Model**

The system maximizes the use of serverless architecture, so costs follow a pay-as-you-go model. To optimze the cost,
we will put region in `us-east-2` and **Redshift** will only used in 1 hour.
The estimated monthly cost breakdown is as follows:

| AWS services                     | Cost / Week        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------|
| Amazon S3                        | $1.50              |
| EventBridge, Step Functions      | $0.15              |
| AWS Lambda                       | $0.00 (Free Tier)  |
| AWS Glue DataBrew                | $7.50              |
| Amazon Redshift                  | $11.00             |
| Amazon Athena                    | $0.50              |
| Amazon QuickSight                | $8.00              |
| IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SNS | $1.00              |
| **Total**                        | **$29.65**         |
