**Project Summary (Executive Summary)**

- Summary: This project aims to build an automated data processing system (Data Analytics Pipeline) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. The system is designed with an event-driven and serverless architecture, specialized for processing, cleaning, and analyzing large-scale taxi trip record datasets (TLC Trip Record Data - Yellow Taxi). The ultimate goal is to transform raw data into high-value insights that support business decision-making through interactive dashboards.
- Objectives:
  - Fully automate the data collection and processing workflow (ETL) from source to Data Warehouse.
  - Ensure data quality through automatic error detection and removal of noisy data such as outliers and missing values before analysis.
  - Provide a flexible analytics platform that supports both fast ad-hoc queries and in-depth OLAP analysis.
  - Visualize business data such as trip demand, revenue, and spatial distribution for leadership teams.
- Scope:
  - Build a Data Lake (Raw & Processed Layers) on Amazon S3.
  - Implement an automated ETL pipeline using AWS Step Functions, Lambda, and Glue DataBrew.
  - Integrate Amazon Redshift as the data warehouse and Amazon Athena as the query layer.
  - Build a BI reporting system on Amazon QuickSight.
  - Set up security, monitoring, and alerting systems using CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS.

**Problem Statement**

Current Challenges: The Yellow Taxi dataset from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission contains a massive amount of information, but the raw data also includes a significant amount of noise and anomalies:

- Poor data quality: There are trips with no passengers (`passenger_count = null`), zero distance (`trip_distance = 0`), or negative fares (`fare_amount < 0`).
- Lack of automation: Manual processing or legacy systems are time-consuming, error-prone, and unable to scale as data volume grows monthly with new Parquet/CSV files.
- Fragmented information: Data is not centralized into a single source of truth, making revenue reporting and customer behavior analysis difficult and slow.

Technical Solution: Deploy a modern Data Lakehouse architecture on AWS:

- Automatic triggering (event-driven): Use Amazon EventBridge to automatically capture events whenever new data files are uploaded, eliminating manual steps.
- Strict quality control: Use AWS Glue DataBrew for profiling and AWS Lambda for branching logic. For example, automatically send an alert if the data error rate is greater than 20%; otherwise continue the pipeline.
- Standardization and optimization: Clean the data, create additional meaningful features such as `trip_duration` and `trip_speed`, and store it in columnar Parquet format with partitioning to optimize cost and query performance.

**Solution Architecture**

The system architecture follows this processing flow:
Raw &rarr; Processing &rarr; Analytics &rarr; Visualization.

Technical Architecture (Workflow Overview)

- Ingestion: Raw data (Parquet/CSV) is uploaded to the S3 Raw Bucket in the Data Lake.
- Trigger: An `ObjectCreated` event from S3 triggers EventBridge.
- Orchestration: EventBridge invokes Step Functions to orchestrate the entire pipeline lifecycle, including retries and logging.
- Profiling: Glue DataBrew analyzes the dataset to identify anomalies such as missing values, outliers, and mismatches.
- Validation: Lambda reads the profiling results to determine the next step or send an error alert.
- Transformation: A Glue DataBrew recipe executes ETL tasks including data cleaning, type standardization, and feature engineering.
- Processed Storage: Cleaned data is stored in the S3 Processed Bucket in Parquet format, partitioned by Year/Month/Day.
- Data Warehousing: The `COPY` command loads data from S3 into the `fact_taxi_trip` table in Amazon Redshift for OLAP workloads. In parallel, Amazon Athena supports ad-hoc querying directly on S3.
- Visualization: Amazon QuickSight connects to Redshift and Athena to display dashboards such as Trip Demand, Revenue, and Spatial Analysis.

Cost Estimation Model

The system maximizes the use of serverless architecture, so costs follow a pay-as-you-go model. The estimated monthly cost breakdown is as follows:

- AWS Services:
  - AWS Amplify Hosting: $0.00 under the Free Tier, including 500 build minutes and 5 GB of delivered data. After the Free Tier: about $0.01/minute x 500 = $5.00/month.
  - AWS Lambda: $0.00/month for 20,000 requests/day, 128 MB memory, and 200 ms average duration.
  - Amazon API Gateway: $0.00/month for 600,000 requests/month, which stays under the Free Tier.
  - Amazon DynamoDB: $0.00/month for 5 GB of data and 100K read/write requests per day.
  - Amazon S3 (image storage): $0.12/month for 10 GB of storage and 5,000 GET/PUT requests.
  - Amazon SES (email sending): $0.00/month for 2,000 emails/month within the Free Tier.
  - Amazon Personalize: $0.00 for the first 2 months for 20 GB of data and 50,000 interactions. After that: about $8.00/month with batch inference for a small dataset and weekly retraining at $0.067 per 1,000 interactions.
  - Custom dashboard (Amplify + Chart.js): $0.00/month using the existing Amplify setup and data from S3/DynamoDB.
  - Amazon Location Service: $0.00/month for 10,000 map requests and 1,000 geolocation requests.
  - Amazon EventBridge (Scheduler): $0.00/month for 10 daily/hourly trigger rules.
  - AWS IAM + KMS + WAF: $0.00/month for basic authentication, encryption, and security.
- Total estimated cost:
  - Month 1: $0.12/month, with everything within the Free Tier.
  - Month 2: $5.12/month, with Personalize still in the Free Tier and Amplify beginning to incur charges.
  - After the Free Tier ends: $13.12/month, approximately $157.44/year.
