# Cost Control

## Capacity

- Use low base capacity (4 RPU) for hands-on work
- Increase when heavy queries are needed, but reduce immediately after
- Monitor usage in Redshift console

## Query Optimization

- Use LIMIT in test queries
- Filter by partitions (year, month) to reduce data scans
- Avoid unnecessary full dataset queries

# Resource Cleanup

After completing the workshop:

1. **Delete Redshift workgroup and namespace**:
   - Redshift console → Serverless dashboard
   - Select workgroup → Delete
   - Select namespace → Delete

2. **Delete Glue resources** (if not needed):
   - Crawlers: glue-crawler-processed-yellow-taxi
   - Databases: redshift_database
   - Tables: processed_yellow_taxi_trip_data

3. **Delete IAM roles**:
   - AmazonRedshift-CommandsAccessRole-...
   - glue-role-manhattan-processed-crawler

4. **Empty S3 buckets** if data is not needed (but keep for ETL pipeline)

# Notes

- Redshift Serverless only charges when queries are running
- If workgroup exists but unused, minimal charges may still occur
- Monitor Billing console to track usage
